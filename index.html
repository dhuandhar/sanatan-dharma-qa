            {q: "I am confused. What is the difference between Hindu, Hinduism, Hindutva, Sanatana Dharma?", c: "Hinduism", a: "Sanatana Dharma literally translates as 'eternal laws' of this universe. Imagine you are a passive observer of everything that is happening in the universe and diligently recording your thoughts as words. That correctly recorded compendium will be called as 'eternal laws'.\n\nSomewhere down the past thousand years, the word Hinduism became equivalent to Sanatana Dharma. Hindu is one who follows Hinduism. Alternately, a Hindu can also be called as Sanatani. Finally, Hindutva is that 'quality of being Hindu'. A Hindu is one who has belief in the validity of scriptures - Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas, Itihasas.\n\nRemember that although you can experience sun and sun-light as two different objects, there is no sun-light without sun and there cannot be a sun without sun-light. Hindutva is to understood like that. There is no Hindu without Hindutva."},
            {q: "How is the Hindu God(s) different from Christian God/Holy Father or Islam's Allah?", c: "God", a: "In Hinduism, Ishwara is the nearest equivalent to the word God. Ishwara is that principle that has created this universe, sustains it and dissolves it into itself. In our traditions, Ishwara is like the CEO of the company delegating power to manage different aspects.\n\nIslam's Allah and Christian God are very different concepts. In Hinduism, everything can be called Ishwara - a stone, air, water, fire, your parent, a baby, an old man, a tree, an insect, a bird, an animal. In Hinduism, there is no 'God' who will sit in judgement after your death. We have a very simple & practical idea - what you sow is what you get. Ishwara is neither jealous nor angry. He neither differentiates between 'believers' & 'non-believers'. In Ishwara's eyes everything is equal."},
            {q: "Why should I be a Hindu and not convert to Christianity or Islam?", c: "Conversion", a: "What is your goal of converting away from Hinduism? Is it that you don't understand the subject, so you now want to change your major? Or is it that something in the other religions is attracting you? Have you fully evaluated the pros & cons?\n\nImportantly, have you made an honest attempt to learn about Hinduism first? What if, a few years later, you regret your decision? Hinduism does not ask you to believe in anything, but invites you to verify everything. Hinduism helps you to live & let live happily."},
            {q: "What's wrong in being an atheist if you are a good person?", c: "Atheism", a: "The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines 'atheist' as 'someone who does not believe in the existence of God'. Moreover, in this very definition, it is presumed that the atheist knows about God, which seems illogical. How can you know or not know something without defining it first?\n\nHinduism does not ask you to believe anything at all. Hinduism invites you to verify everything. In Hinduism, the equivalent word is 'asthika/na-asthika'. An 'asthika' is one who 'believes' in Vedas and 'nastika' is one who does not. Being an atheist and a good person is much better than being an 'asthika and a bad person'."},
            {q: "If Ishwara (or God!) is everywhere why should I go to temples at all?", c: "Hinduism", a: "Will you take a dip anywhere in a very powerful river like Ganga or will you look for bathing ghats where it is easier to take a dip? Similarly, while Ishwara is everywhere, we go to the temple because it aids in accelerating the process of attaining our goals.\n\nYour like or dislike to go to a temple is irrelevant. If you like you will go. If you dislike, you need to figure out another way. The choice is yours - either take the easy, well proven way or find your own way through trial & error. Irrespective whether you go to temple or not, if you have a mindset to follow Vedas, you are a Hindu."},
            {q: "What is the usefulness of rituals - like daily puja?", c: "Rituals", a: "Would you dismiss the routine a football player follows to warm up before a game? Would you say that warm ups, push-ups, planks, burpees for a martial arts expert are irrelevant?\n\nIf you answer no to at least one of the above, then you have understood the value of consistency and repetition. A Hindu ritual is something that helps build a person's character. For example, if someone takes a vow to do a particular puja daily at 6AM everyday, then that simple ritual becomes the central theme that would govern the person's life - sleeping time gets regulated, bathing before chanting becomes a habit etc."},
            {q: "Do festivals have meaning behind them?", c: "Festivals", a: "In Sanatana Dharma, every festival is a celebration of some kind. There are festivals where we celebrate the symbolic victory of good over evil (like Deepavali). There are festivals where we celebrate the birth of great saints or Avataras. There are festivals where we celebrate seasonal changes. There are festivals where we also celebrate harvesting seasons. There are festivals to celebrate certain astrological phenomena.\n\nIn short, every festival will have a purpose and meaning behind them."},
            {q: "Hinduism seems very patriarchal. What place do women have in Hinduism?", c: "Women", a: "Women are placed on a higher pedestal in Hinduism. They are to be protected and cherished. They are the bearers and transmitters of culture in a family. Hinduism does not place any restrictions on women doing any roles as long as their biology is able to support it.\n\nHinduism emphatically states that all beings are equal, and have the same inner Self, but are wrapped in different biological forms. Such a religion will never agree to the concept of superiority or inferiority based on sex of a person."},
            {q: "Why should we sit down and eat? Why should we use our hands to eat?", c: "Rituals", a: "There is no hard and fast rule that we should not use dining tables or cutlery. Having said that, it becomes very practical to combine exercise like sitting down with eating. If we eat for about 20-30min, that is equivalent to moderate exercise to our lower body.\n\nAs regards to eating with hands: Ask yourself if you know in whose mouth(s) the spoon/fork you are using has gone into? Ask the same question with respect to your hands. It is appalling to think that eating with cutlery is more hygienic when practical observation doesn't show it."},
            {q: "What is the concept of caste? Isn't discriminating against other humans terrible?", c: "Hinduism", a: "The concept of caste is a Western concept brought to India. According to sastras, we had division based on varna and jati. Varna divides any human into four categories based on the qualities of their mind and their natural inclination for work: brahmana (learner, teacher), kshatriya (protector, administrator), vysya (trader, farmer), sudra (server to the first three).\n\nThis division is based not on birth, but on the qualities of mind and natural inclination for the type of work. How is plain observation and codification of human nature wrong?"},
            {q: "Is dating before marriage allowed? Is pre-marital sex allowed as per Hinduism?", c: "Marriage", a: "'Dating' can mean many things - exploring a connection, physical/emotional intimacy and a first step to a goal. Hinduism calls long term peaceful relationship as marriage.\n\nArranged marriages are proven to be more successful. Marriages in Hinduism help the couple achieve their goals - security, wealth, desire and finally, freedom! If there is no 'commitment' from the very beginning, there is always a chance that it may break off. Pre-marital sex is not approved of in Sanatana Dharma."},
            {q: "Can I marry a non-Hindu? What do shastras say?", c: "Marriage", a: "Shastras see marriage as a union for achieving four human goals - dharma, artha, kaama, and moksha. One can marry a non-Hindu as long as the couple understand the concept of marriage and the grandiose vision in which marriage forms an essential step.\n\nIf both parties agree and work towards the larger goal of mutual growth towards ultimate freedom, we can marry non-Hindu. However, it is obviously easier from adaptation perspective if both belong to similar cultural backgrounds."},
            {q: "What does Hinduism say about non-binary (third gender)?", c: "Modern", a: "According to Hinduism, any species is broadly divided into male and female nature only, as defined by their biology. However, there are exceptions when a person is classified as 'third nature' (tritiya prakriti).\n\nThe Sanskrit dictionary defines the origin of such people as 'when the seeds of both male & female are equally present'. In language, this 'third nature' is presented as someone without the typical male characteristics (na-pumsak, literally meaning, 'not having male characteristics')"},
            {q: "Why should I say yes to Kanyadaan? I don't want to be given away as a possession.", c: "Marriage", a: "This is wrongly understood due to mistranslation in English. 'Kanyadaana' has been wrongly propagated. When you donate money without expecting anything in return, would that be interpreted as 'giving away an object/possession'?\n\nSimilarly, when parents do 'kanyadaana', they are very well aware that what they are giving is not an inanimate object, but a living person capable of great wonders. Kanya-daan is simply 'giving the unmarried girl in marriage without expecting anything in return'."},
            {q: "Isn't abhishekam a waste of milk? We can feed the poor instead.", c: "Rituals", a: "Let us be fair before we raise this objection: aren't there several things that we do today that are wasteful? Why order a pizza when one can eat ten home-cooked meals for the same price? Why fly business class when two can fly economy?\n\nLet us face it - none of us are truly idealistic. People who can afford to spend money should and must spend on worthwhile causes. This creates an ecosystem. However if someone thinks it's a waste, then they should first ask themselves if they are entirely frugal."},
            {q: "Why should I pray? Prayers solving problems seems like just a random event.", c: "Prayer", a: "Prayer is a solemn request for help or expression of thanks. In Hinduism, we believe that prayers help us to reduce the impact of unknown forces that we cannot control. We are not embarrassed to ask for help from those deities/devas who are capable of helping us.\n\nJust because we assume that a prayer has not resulted in the time we expect is illogical. All we can do is to do prayatna (our effort), give it kaala (time) and seek Ishwara's grace (daivam)."},
            {q: "What is Feminism in terms of Sanatan Dharma?", c: "Modern", a: "Nature has not created equals in any species or in any domain. Nature has created unique beings and has put them to interact with each other to grow mentally.\n\nSanatana Dharma emphasizes individual growth with interdependence. Our culture trains us to recognize the differences in the body and mind in the individuals yet realize the equality underneath all those beings. This is the ultimate goal of Sanatana Dharma."}
